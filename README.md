# Greg Smolin - Portfolio Website

I consider myself a creative technocrat. I want to see a future where technology brings out what's best
in humanity. By improving our technology, we can live better lives, in a cleaner environment and
stronger community. I strive every day to improve my skills, learn something new, and engage in
meaningful conversations. Let's build the future together!
